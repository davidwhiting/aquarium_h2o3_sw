    "This notebook uses variants of residual analysis to find error mechanisms and security vulnerabilities and to assess stability and fairness in a trained XGBoost model. It begins by loading the UCI credit card default data and then training an interpretable, monotonically constrained XGBoost gradient boosting machine (GBM) model. (Pearson correlation with the prediction target is used to determine the direction of the monotonicity constraints for each input variable.) After the model is trained, its logloss residuals are analyzed and explained thoroughly and the constrained GBM is compared to a benchmark linear model. These model debugging exercises uncover several accuracy, drift, and security problems such as over-emphasis of important variables and strong signal in model residuals. Several remediation mechanisms are proposed including missing value injection during training, additional data collection, and use of assertions to correct known problems during scoring. \n",

Pearson correlation provides a linear measure of the direction of the relationship between each input variable and the target. If the pair-wise Pearson correlation between an input and `DEFAULT_NEXT_MONTH` is positive, it will be constrained to have an increasing relationship with the predictions for `DEFAULT_NEXT_MONTH`. If the pair-wise Pearson correlation is negative, the input will be constrained to have a decreasing relationship with the predictions for `DEFAULT_NEXT_MONTH`. \n",

According to the calculated values, as a customer's balance limit (`LIMIT_BAL`), bill amounts (`BILL_AMT1`-`BILL_AMT6`), and payment amounts (`PAY_AMT1`-`PAY_AMT6`) increase, their probability of default tends to decrease. However as a customer's number of late payments increase (`PAY_0`, `PAY_2`-`PAY6`), their probability of default usually increases. In general, the Pearson correlation values make sense, and they will be used to ensure that the modeled relationships will make sense as well.

    "Here it appears there are no single Shapley contributions that can be associated with only high residuals. Every extremely high residual value also has low residual values for the same Shapley value. However, it can be seen that some Shapley values are only associated with low residuals, for instance `0 < PAY_0` Contribs. `< 0.5` or `PAY_3` Contribs. `< -0.2`. If trying to detect scoring problems in real-time, Shapley values in these ranges for these features could indicate that these predictions are likely to be correct. Also, in terms of local feature importance, the model is not treating `SEX` very differently -- a good sign from a fairness perspective but not a definitive test. From a security perspective, high residuals above low residuals are potentially interesting. These are individuals the model usually gets right, but for some reason they did not in this case. That could indicate manipulation of the training data or model scoring logic in rare cases.\n",

    "* Visualize residuals and learn about outlying, wrong predictions and to see that the trained model is too dependent on one input variable: `PAY_0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Examine multiple types of errors across the levels of categorical variables and found that the model behaves poorly for `PAY_0 >= 2` but seems to have roughly similar error characteristics across men and women.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare monotonic GBM predictions to simpler linear model predictions and discovered a group of customers for which the simpler linear model performs better than the GBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analyze residuals with post-hoc explainable AI techniques to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Shapley contributions to predictions and to the GBM model's logloss, and to see that some variables are actually more important globally to the logloss than to the predictions.\n",
    "  * Shapley prediction contributions and their relationships to the model residuals, and discovered that some Shapley contribution values are only associated with correct model decisions.\n",
    "  * Local Shapley contributions to logloss and to view the exact local contributions of variables to logloss for a high-residual individual.\n",
    "  * Summaries of residual behavior through decision trees and potentially to create model assertions or adversarial examples automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these kinds of model bugs have been identified, new options exist to remediate them during either training or scoring. This model was found to be too dependent on `PAY_0` and there was remaining signal in the model residuals to train accurate decision trees. It seems there is additional information that would lessen this model's over-emphasis of `PAY_0` and perhaps allow the constrained GBM to make more accurate decisions in general. Local contributions to logloss were also calculated. Is it possible to retrain the model with this information in some kind of novel row and column boosting scheme? Can the Shapley prediction contributions and the decision tree rules for residuals be used to create model assertions automatically? More importantly than this one toy case, can these strategies be applied to find accuracy, fairness, or security bugs in different types of models?"
