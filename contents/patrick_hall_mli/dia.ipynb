    "# Increase Fairness in Your Machine Learning Project with Disparate Impact Analysis using Python and H2O\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assess if your machine learning model is treating different groups of people similarly or differently\n",
    "\n",
    "Fairness is an incredibly important, but highly complex entity. So much so that leading scholars have yet to agree on a strict definition. However, there is a practical way to discuss and handle *observational* fairness, or how your model predictions affect different groups of people. This procedure is known as disparate impact analysis (DIA). DIA is far from perfect, as it relies heavily on user-defined thresholds and reference levels for disparity and does not attempt to remediate disparity or provide information on sources of disparity, but it is a fairly straightforward method to quantify your model’s behavior across sensitive demographic segments or other potentially interesting groups of observations. DIA is also an accepted, regulation-compliant tool for fair-lending purposes in the U.S. financial services industry. If it’s good enough for multibillion-dollar credit portfolios, it’s probably good enough for your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example DIA notebook starts by training a gradient boosting machine (GBM) classifier on the UCI credit card default data using the popular open source library, h2o. A probability cutoff for making credit decisions is selected by maximizing the F1 statistic and confusion matrices are generated to summarize the GBM’s decisions across customers with different education levels. A basic DIA procedure is then conducted using the information stored in the confusion matrices. \n",

In fact, tuning cutoffs carefully is a potential remdiation tactic for any discovered disparity.

    "In general the GBM appears to have accuracy, negative predicted value, and specificity parity, but likely has a disparate impact across education levels for all other metrics. It fails to meet the criteria of overall fairness. To address such disparate impact users could tune the GBM cutoff or regularization, could try new methods for reweighing data prior to model training or try new modeling methods specifically designed for fairness. Simply dropping the variable `EDUCATION` is likely an inappropriate solution. In nonlinear models, different variables are combined by the model to represent strong signals. If a variable is important in a dataset, model, or problem domain it's likely that a nonlinear model will find combinations of other variables to act as proxies for the problematic variable -- potentially even different combinations for different rows of data!. So by simply dropping the variable from the model, you will likely not solve the disparate impact problem, but instead just make it harder to diagnose."

    "This notebook outlines a basic approach to DIA. In a complex, real-world machine learning project the hard-to-define phenomenas of sociological bias and unfairness can materialize in many ways and from many different sources. Although far from a flawless technique, the beauty of DIA is it is straightforward to implement, functions in a model-agnostic fashion on known labels and model predictions, and is applied in complex real-world fair lending situations, so it can probably be applied to your model too!\n",
