    "# Increase Fairness in Your Machine Learning Project with Disparate Impact Analysis using Python and H2O\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assess if your machine learning model is treating different groups of people similarly or differently\n",
    "\n",
    "Fairness is an incredibly important, but highly complex entity. So much so that leading scholars have yet to agree on a strict definition. However, there is a practical way to discuss and handle *observational* fairness, or how your model predictions affect different groups of people. This procedure is often known as disparate impact analysis (DIA). DIA is far from perfect, as it relies heavily on user-defined thresholds and reference levels for disparity and does not attempt to remediate disparity or provide information on sources of disparity, but it is a fairly straightforward method to quantify your model’s behavior across sensitive demographic segments or other potentially interesting groups of observations. DIA is also an accepted, regulation-compliant tool for fair-lending purposes in the U.S. financial services industry. If it’s good enough for multibillion-dollar credit portfolios, it’s probably good enough for your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example DIA notebook starts by training a constrained, monotonic gradient boosting machine (GBM) classifier on the UCI credit card default data using the popular open source library, h2o. A probability cutoff for making credit decisions is selected by maximizing the F1 statistic and confusion matrices are generated to summarize the GBM’s decisions across male and female customers. A basic DIA procedure is then conducted using the information stored in the confusion matrices to calculate an adverse impact ratio. Several other disparity and parity metrics are calculated, and although it's abusing the technique, those will also be discussed and analyzed in the context of DIA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because DIA really only considers groups of people, it's important to pair DIA with constrained models that can't treat similar people too differently. When using complex models with DIA, it's also important to look for any local, or individual, dicrimination that would not be flagged in the group quantities.\n",

    "Predictive models often produce probabilities, not decisions. So to make a decision with a model-generated predicted probability for any one customer, you must specify a numeric cutoff above which we say a customer will default and below which we say they will not default. Cutoffs play a crucial role in DIA as they impact the underlying measurements used to calculate diparity. In fact, tuning cutoffs carefully is a potential remdiation tactic for any discovered disparity. There are many accepted ways to select a cutoff (besides simply using 0.5) and in this notebook the cutoff will be selected by striking a balance between the model's recall (true positive rate) and it's precision using the F1 statistic. Using precision and recall to select a cutoff is sometimes seen as more robust to imbalanced data than the standard ROC approach. Maximizing F1 typically results in a good balance between sensitivity and precision. \n",

    "Importantly, the GBM appears to have adverse impact parity, and many other types of positive parity characteristics. However, the model is still suffering from a minor disparity problem due to it's propensity to make false positive predictions. To address such disparate impact users could tune the GBM cutoff or regularization, could try new methods for reweighing data prior to model training, try new modeling methods specifically designed for fairness, or post-process the decisions. Before attempting remediation, local or individual fairness will also be investigated.\n",

    "In nonlinear models, similar people can be treated differenly by the model, so even if the model is mostly fair for most kinds of people, there could still be people the model treated unfairly. This could occur for multiple reasons, including the functional form of the learned model or because different variables are combined by the model to represent strong signals. If a variable is important in a dataset, model, or problem domain it's likely that a nonlinear model will find combinations of other variables to act as proxies for the problematic variable -- potentially even different combinations for different rows of data! So by simply testing for group fairness, you may miss instances of individual discrimination.\n",

Although far from a flawless technique, the beauty of DIA is it is straightforward to implement, functions in a model-agnostic fashion on known labels and model predictions, and is applied in complex real-world fair lending situations, so it can probably be applied to your model too! \n",
