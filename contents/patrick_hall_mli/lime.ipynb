    "# Explain Your Predictive Models to Business Stakeholders using LIME with Python and H2O\n",
    "#### Describing complex models and generating reason codes with Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and LIME-variants\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) shed light on how almost any machine learning model makes decisions for specific rows of data. LIME builds local linear surrogate models around observations of interest and leverages the highly interpretable properties of linear models to increase transparency and accountability for the corresponding model predictions. In this notebook, an h2o GBM is trained on the UCI credit card default data and then predictions for a highly risky customer are explained using linear model coefficients and LIME-derived reason codes. The notebook concludes by introducing a variant of LIME that is easier to execute on new data and that can be analyzed alongside observed (i.e., not simulated) data.\n",

    "**Note**: As of the h2o 3.24 \"Yates\" release, Shapley values are supported in h2o. Shapley values can be used in place of or along with LIME.

LOCO importance values are nonlinear, do consider interactions, and do not explicitly consider a linear intercept or offset. **Because most currently-available explanatory techniques are approximate, it is recommended that users employ several different explanatory techniques and trust only consisent results across techniques.
