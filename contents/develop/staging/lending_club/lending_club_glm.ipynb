    "In general, machine learning models require hyper-parameter tuning to capture the signal in the data without overfitting the noise. To aid in this effort, H2O provides and [`H2OGridSearch`](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-py/docs/modeling.html?highlight=h2ogridsearch#h2o.grid.grid_search.H2OGridSearch) framework to automate hyper-parameter exploration.\n",

    "In the context of logistic regression, the most important hyper-parameter is `alpha`, which balances the importance given to L1 and L2 regularization on the coefficient estimates. When `alpha = 0` only L2 regularization is used (ridge regression), when `alpha = 1` only L1 regularization is used (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)), and when `alpha` is somewhere in-between a combination of the two are used (elastic-net)."
