    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparkling Water provides access to H2O algorithms and publishes an API to integrate them as part of regular Spark pipelines. This feature allows for seamless training and deployment of H2O algorithms in the Spark environment. Furthermore, thanks to MOJO (java binary) representations of trained H2O models, production pipelines do not require access to H2O runtime. This enables a wide variety of deployment scenarios. Similarly, Sparkling Water can be used for deploying MOJOs from Driverless AI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, by supporting Python and Scala environments, we enable a simple transfer of modeling results between data scientists (\"Python land\") and production (\"JVM land\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this hands-on are two-fold:\n",
    "  - Show integration of H2O models into Spark pipelines using PySpark and PySparkling,\n",
    "  - Demonstrate deployment of the trained pipeline in the context of JVM and Spark streaming.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Our modeling goal is to predict sentiment of Amazon food reviews. For this purpose, we use a pre-processed dataset from [SNAP repository](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html). The dataset contains multiple columns but for simplicity, we will use only `date`, `summary` and overall `score`. The score helps us to approximate sentiment.\n",
