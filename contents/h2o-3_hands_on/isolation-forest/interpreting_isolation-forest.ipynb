    "The idea behind Isolation Forest is that anomalies are easier to separate from the rest of the data than other points.  The Isolation Forest algorithm partitions the data through a forest of decision trees.  Each split is made randomly.  The number of splits it takes to isolate a record indicates whether or not the record is an anomaly. When a forest of random trees collectively produces shorter path lengths for particular samples, they are highly likely to be anomalies.\n",
