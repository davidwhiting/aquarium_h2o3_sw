    "# Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forests using H2O\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly detection is a common data science problem where the goal is to identify odd or suspicious observations, events, or items in our data that might be indicative of some issues in our data collection process (such as broken sensors, typos in collected forms, etc.) or unexpected events like security breaches, server failures, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly detection can be performed in a supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a supervised approach, we need to know whether each observation, event or item is anomalous or genuine, and we use this information during training. Obtaining labels for each observation might often be unrealistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A semi-supervised approach uses the assumption that we only know which observations are genuine, non-anomalous, and we do not have any information on the anomalous observations. Therefore we only use the genuine data for training. During prediction, the model evaluates how similar the new observation is to the training data and how well it fits the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "An unsupervised approach assumes that the training set contains both genuine and anomalous observations. As labeling the data or having just clean data is often hard and time consuming, I would like to focus more on one of the unsupervised approaches to anomaly detection using isolation forests.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are multiple approaches to an unsupervised anomaly detection problem that try to exploit the differences between the properties of common and unique observations. The idea behind the [Isolation Forest](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/icdm08b.pdf) is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We start by building multiple decision trees such that the trees isolate the observations in their leaves. Ideally, each leaf of the tree isolates exactly one observation from your data set. The trees are being split randomly. We assume that if one observation is similar to others in our data set, it will take more random splits to perfectly isolate this observation, as opposed to isolating an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For an outlier that has some feature values significantly different from the other observations, randomly finding the split isolating it should not be too hard. As we build multiple isolation trees, hence the isolation forest, for each observation we can calculate the average number of splits across all the trees that isolate the observation. The average number of splits is then used as a score, where the less splits the observation needs, the more likely it is to be anomalous. \n",
