## Note: This lab is under construction!

## Instructions:

  1.  Click the "Start Lab" button below.
  1.  *Note that the lab automatically ends after the number of minutes shown above!*
  1.  Also note that you may re-take the lab once it ends.
  1.  After the lab is fully started, RStudio and Jupyter URL links will appear below.  Click on one.  (H2O and Spark links also appear, but won't work properly until you start H2O or Sparkling Water from inside the lab.)
  1.  When RStudio prompts you for a username and password, enter "h2o" and "h2o".  When Jupyter prompts you for a token, enter "h2o".
  1.  Navigate to the h2o_3_hands_on (Jupyter or RStudio) or sparkling_water_hands_on (Jupyter only) directory.
  1.  Choose a lab to run.

(You don't need to do this now, but you can also find the materials for the lab in <a href="https://github.com/davidwhiting/aquarium_h2o3_sw/" target="_blank">Github</a>.)
